# smart-list

The idea for this application is to create a smart, cloud based generic list which learns as it grows and is used. It provides an easier shopping experience using reminders and alerts. The app would essentially be an AI assistant which tracks and learns usage. With more frequent use, the app becomes more accurate, like how Google Now functions.

The end-user would essentially build a list of their choice and set quantifiable value such as dates, quantities, etc. which is then stored on their cloud-based account. The application would keep a track and present reminders and insightful information regarding their list.

The core idea behind the application is building a virtual assistant similar to what Google Now provides but on a more task based level
